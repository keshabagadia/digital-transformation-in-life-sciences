Digital transformation is a top-to-bottom reimagining and rebuilding of business and cultural processes. As it is an undertaking far too large for a six month period, we worked on certain modules of the project. For our purpose, we worked on the data engineering process for the development of KPIs (short for Key Performance Indicator) and their visual analytical widgets. The departments we worked on were Supply Chain and Operations and Finance.

Our progress through the project period can be summarised as follows:
- During our first month of the internship, we were trained with Accenture on the current market scenario and the potential paths of growth, the functional technical stack of the industry and different use cases of the kind of work we’d be doing. 
- Soon after, we started attending brainstorming and business requirement ideation sessions with respective departments and their teams. KPIs and their logic are decided, and the respective data is provided.
- Working and designing the data transformation solution was the succeeding step. 
- Implementation of the solution followed. 
- Data validation and revision come next. It is an iterative and unpredictable phase as while it’s time-bound, there is no telling of the kind of handicaps one may face.
- KPI is built over the data pipeline and sent for deployment to the full-stack team.
- Repeating the process from the beginning with a new KPI.

Each KPI comes with its unique set of logic and problems, and there was a lot of learning, technical and non-technical alike involved in the entire process. The end goal was to clean and transform data into a form upon which actionable insights can be developed.

We worked with Azure Data Factory and Azure Logic Apps for our purpose.
